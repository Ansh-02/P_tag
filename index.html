    <h1>Welcome to INDIA TV 18 News</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Scam 1992’ gave us the Hansal Mehta-directed Harshad Mehta story, and the 2020 show stays high on the best Indian web series pole: now it’s the turn of stamp-paper counterfeiter Abdul Karim Telgi in ‘Scam 2003’, based on Sanjay Singh’s book ‘Telgi Scam : Reporter’s Ki Diary’, directed by Tushar Hiranandani, and show-run by Hansal Mehta. Telgi was caught, and he died in jail, but his ‘daring toh karna padega darling’ schemes which gave him unimaginable returns, showed up the holes in the ‘system’ which rules us, a system that keeps the common man out of power-and-wealth circles.

        Though comparisons are odious, this new series is sure to be held up against the first one, which was an acute, insightful portrait of pre-liberalisation India, and how the Big Bull unerringly found all the soft spots to press on his heady journey to the very top of the stock market. Pratik Gandhi, as Harshad Mehta, had zing, and the whole thing was done most entertainingly.
